# node-scrypt-async-compatibility

This is a tiny glue package in case you

- Use scrypt
- Were using [node-scrypt](https://github.com/barrysteyn/node-scrypt)
- Want to use [scrypt-async](https://github.com/dchest/scrypt-async-js/)
- Have tons of existing hashes
- Want to actually keep them.

## How this works

this section needs to be expanded, right now the tests are probably the best
documentation on how this works in practice.
